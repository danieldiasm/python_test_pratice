# tests-with-python
This is a repository that contains software testing using python.

You'll find Pytest and mainly Unittest tests in here.

There are:
- Byproduct of praticing on Tests Courses of LinkedIn courses
- Byproduct of praticing on Tests from Udemy courses, such as:
  - [Jose Salvatierra - Automated SW Test with Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/automated-software-testing-with-python/)

I'm generally not sharing someone else's code. The ones found here were produced by me, if happens of something being copied
it will contain the propper credits on the code. Regardless of this repo being licenced as "The Unlicence", mind you if that
contains credits, it might have to be handled as required by the propper owner of the original code.

That is it for now...
